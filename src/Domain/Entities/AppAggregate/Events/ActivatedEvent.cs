 Here are some examples of events that could be associated with an App class in C#:

StartupNotificationHandler: This event is raised when the application starts up. This could be used to perform initialization tasks, such as setting up a database connection or loading configuration settings.
ExitNotificationHandler: This event is raised when the application is about to shut down. This could be used to perform cleanup tasks, such as saving user data or closing open files.
SessionEndingNotificationHandler: This event is raised when the user is about to log off or shut down the system. This could be used to prompt the user to save any unsaved data before the application is closed.
ActivatedNotificationHandler: This event is raised when the application is activated, either by the user or by the system. This could be used to bring the application to the foreground and allow the user to interact with it.
DeactivatedNotificationHandler: This event is raised when the application is deactivated, either by the user or by the system. This could be used to perform tasks such as pausing background processes or saving the application's state.
These are just a few examples of events that could be associated with an App class in C#. There may be other events available depending on the specific implementation of the App class.
